# 1. Decision Tree and Bagging Classifier algo classification
# 2. Churn Prediction for Telephone Company
# 3. Telescope rays classification using multiple classification algorithms
# 4. Credit Card Fraud Detection
The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy of detecting credit card fraudulent activities. The model will be trained on a dataset of credit card transactions and the goal is to improve the measure called Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). Additionally, the project aims to acquire more knowledge about the financial industry and how to apply machine learning to real-world problems.
